# Puffer-Info

## About the Bot

Puffer is basically a meme bot. It can be used for moderation purposes in your discord server, or just for fun. You can rickroll some friends or just have fun feeding it until it explodes. (Injuries are not at the fault of the bot, nor the creator. The bot doesn't actually explode, so any threats will be taken with a grain of salt.) 

## All things logged:

Message content: For when an argument error occurs. It doesn't matter if you shoved a chicken tender, or entire chicken, down your throat, whatever happens with Puffer, stays with Puffer.

Command: You already know why this must be logged.

Error: Gotta know what's going on!
