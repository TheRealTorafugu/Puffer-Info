# Puffer Info

## About the Bot

Puffer is basically a meme bot. It can be used for moderation purposes in your Discord server, or just for fun. You can rickroll some friends or just have fun feeding it until it explodes. (Injuries are not at the fault of the bot, nor the creator. The bot doesn't actually explode, so any threats will be taken with a grain of salt.) 

## All things logged:

Message content: For when an argument error occurs. It doesn't matter if you shoved a chicken tender, or entire chicken, down your throat. Whatever happens with Puffer, stays with Puffer.

Command: To find what command is faulty in the event of an error.

Error: Gotta know what's going on!

Server IDs: Only logged when a bansave is made. No server IDs will be logged until a ban list is saved by a human, and even then, I'm not gonna look at it. Since server IDs are random, it just means I have the opportunity to make my code easier.
